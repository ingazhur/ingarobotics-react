The eye-tracking system is based on [electrooculography (EOG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrooculography) technique (not cameras, as compared to the standard in AR/VR applications), and allows basic control of a [Chrome dinosaur game](https://trex-runner.com/) with blinks. On the GIF, electrodes are attached to the area above and below my eye that measures voltage difference between the two sites. That signal is later filtered and amplifier through an analog front-end PCB that later connects to a laptop for visualization.\n", "tags": ["neurotech", " hardware"], "img": "../imgs/eog.png"}]
